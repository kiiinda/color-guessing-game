# color-guessing-game
It is an RGB color guessing game with two levels:hard and easy.
It works by selecting a square that would match the combination of the RGB values at the top.
If the correct square is selected, the other squares will change color to match the equivalent correct combination.
If the wrong square is selected, that square would disappear until the correct one is found.
